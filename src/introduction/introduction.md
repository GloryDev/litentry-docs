# Introduction

Litentry is a second layer protocol and infrastructure based on Substrate. It focuses on identity data management, authorization and monetization.

Litentry provides tools to:

1. make it possible for any third-party to allow users to access the web app or offline services using an identifier related to their Substrate Account ID as an access token. It based on Substrate so it could easily be integrated cross chains on Polkadot Network. In addition, it could connect with either the existed Blockchain ecosystem like Ethereum and Substrate.

2. Get back the control of user access history and privacy data generated in the apps or services, a user is able to store these encrypted identity related data on a decentralized storage like IPFS or Arweave, or on-chain Database.
 
3. Share the identity anonymously between different platforms, a user do not need to create multiple accounts in order to use different services, and prevent these services for building user profile. No password, no registration, no migration barriers.
