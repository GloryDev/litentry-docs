# Introduction

**Litentry Protocol is helping support change that in favour of a user-centric internet with the blockchain.**

## Concept of User-Centric Internet

As we entrust safe-storage of our passwords and online activity data to third parties on the app-centric internet of today, we are often asked to comply with ambiguous and unfair privacy policies handing over control our own data. As a result our data is often harvested and used in ways we do not have a say in.

Litentry is helping support change that in favor of a user-centric internet with the blockchain. That means the internet should dominant by the users. We decide what services or apps to users, the decision should not limited by the migration cost or specific terms. The profit generated by the user data should go back to user, instead of mainly flows to service provider / companies. 

Litentry includes an identity-based network and related tools, as a whole it consists of a decentralized identity authentication and user activity data management infrastructure.

The protocol and network designed at start is not only fits to the internet, but also fits to all the digital services in the real world.

## Highlights	

#### Blockchain Powered:
Litentry is build on Substrate, which inherits great features and best technologies in the Blockchain industry. Litentry aim to be the Parachain of Polkadot Network and benefit from the thriving cross-chain ecosystem and share security.

#### Identity Management:
Get back the control of user access history and privacy data generated in the apps or services, user's identities are anonymous and independent from each other.

#### Decentralized Storage:
A user is able to store these encrypted identity related data on a decentralized storage like IPFS or Arweave, or on-chain Database. The data is protected by the access control of decentralized storage.

#### Identity Staking: 

With a transparent protocol, an identity owner could stake his identity into identities pool and get regularly reward with data protected. Litentry enable anonymous data matching and permissioned data query. With data protected, Litentry monetize the identity data and benefit identity owner and DApp.

#### Decentralized Ecosystem Contributor:

Share the identity anonymously between different platforms, a user do not need to create multiple accounts in order to use different services, and prevent these services for building user profile. No password, no registration, no migration barriers. Litentry and decentralized ecosystem benefit each other.

## Concept of Decentralization

The decentralization of Litentry includes following aspects:

#### Decentralization of identity storage:
User data, including identity credential, should be storage in the a decentralized storage, instead of the central data server of service provider, currently we support IPFS, in the future we will have other storage support like Arwaeve or Litentry native on-chain key-value store. 

#### Decentralization of identity authentication:
The identity validator connect to the decentralized network periodically, and it could validate the authentication request independently. 

####Decentralization of identity relationships: 
The relationship of data, and identity could be validated with cryptographic calculation, and it is also record in the decentralized network instead of regular centralized service like Certificate Authority used in HTTPS protocol. Different identities belong to owner are not discoverable, and protected by Schnorr25519 Algorithm. 

#### Decentralization of Identity Data Allocation: 
The user data generated when using third party applications/services could be processed by the resolver function on Litentry Network, thus provider user a trustworthy data, with allocate data from variant origins, user are able to get valuable user profile like health info, shopping history, etc. 

## Definitions

#### User: 
The origin of data, it a person who holds identities or IoT devices.

#### Identity:
 It is a generalized concept of identity, not only include the identity of person, but also any thing could generate claims like IoT devices. A person could own multiple identities, like an identity only related to musics, an identity only for data in Germany, or an identity as a game player. It is an anchor to its related data, the id of it does not have any meaning.

#### External Data:
 data generated when using the applications/services and anchored with identity, like the shopping history when a user shopping in e-store, or the age data read from the aforementioned age proving request.

#### Authorization Token:
 A piece of data prove the read or write permission to identity’s external data. Like the permission to read the age data of a person.
