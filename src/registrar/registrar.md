**In the Twitter verification process, users need to follow the Litentry official registrar account, namely Litentry Registrar (@LitentryReg).**



The user's account (public key, wallet address) on the blockchain can remain anonymous since it is loosely connected with the user's identity. However, a user with high reputation can be trusted by the community in the Polkadot ecosystem when he plans to be a validator or a councilor. In this document, we want to introduce a registrar service that focuses on automatic verifications, leveraging well-designed cryptographical challenges to further reduce human interventions. At the moment, Litentry registrar focuses on providing judgment with confidence for a user's `display name`, `email`, `twitter`, or `element name (previously called riot)`.
